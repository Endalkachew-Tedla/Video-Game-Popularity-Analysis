## Video Game Popularity Data Project

**Introduction**: You’re an analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, you’ve been asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.

**Key Questions**:
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
- Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
- How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
  
**Context**: As a professional data analyst, it's crucial to grasp a problem, align it with an appropriate analysis method, utilize data to validate a hypothesis, and convey any discoveries back to the client. Completing an end-to-end analysis enables you to showcase your work and demonstrate your practical technical abilities.

**Target Audience**: The audience for this project is the hypothetical company GameCo, specifically its executives who’ve asked you to gather insights. For a further sense of the “who,” please refer to the hypothetical stakeholder quotes below:
- Vice President of Marketing
- Chief Financial Officer
- Senior Vice President of Sales
  
**Data Set**: You'll be working with a dataset throughout this course that details historical sales of video games, focusing on games that sold more than 10,000 copies. The data covers various platforms, genres, and publishing studios and was sourced from VGChartz.

Here are some key points about the dataset to keep in mind:

- It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not financial figures) from 1980 to 2016.
- Sales figures are represented in millions of units. For example, "1.2" indicates 1.2 million units sold.
- You can download the [video game sales dataset](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx) to explore further.
- To understand how this data was collected and correlated, take a look at [VGChartz's methodology](http://vgchartz.com/methodology.php).

**Project Deliverables**: The project culminates in a comprehensive analysis, backed by SQL queries, visualizations, and a narrative that translates complex data into actionable business insights.

**Final Analysis**
- The final analysis includes summary statistics for several variables.
- Three different types of visualizations have been incorporated, each clearly labeled.
- The visualizations have been crafted to maintain a professional standard suitable for presentation to a potential employer.

**Insights**
- Overall, the most popular genre in North America and Europe is Action games, while in Japan, it is Role Playing games. Let's continue to build upon this success by investing more marketing budget money into these specific genres to see continued growth.
- The top platforms for North America, Europe, and Other Sales are PS4 and XOne.
= Nintendo was the most popular Publisher across North America, Europe, and Japan.
- Since 2010, sales in North America have been rapidly declining and don’t seem to be returning to previous sales records. However, NA does hold 49 percent of the global sales, which is a positive sign.
